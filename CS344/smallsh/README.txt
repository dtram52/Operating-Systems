Please compile with "gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c"
My program will function with the grading script. To run it, place it in the same directory as my compiled shell, chmod it (chmod +x ./p3testscript) and run this command from a bash prompt:

$ p3testscript 2>&1
otherwise you can make it executable and run with smallsh
